# Benefits

Database Gateway provides secure, reliable, and cost-effective database connection services.

-   Security: You do not need to open public ports for your databases. Account permissions are authenticated for network access at each layer. Additionally, HTTPS is used to implement natural asymmetric encryption on data transport links. For more information about security, see [Security](t570060.md#).
-   Ease of use: Database Gateway does not require large amounts of network and routing configurations. It allows you to connect your databases to Alibaba Cloud within minutes simply by using an AccessKey pair.
-   Cost-effectiveness: Database Gateway provides free database connection services. The local gateway agent can run on any server with available memory. Because of this, you do not need to purchase Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\), Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\), and Express Connect separately. In transmission over the public network, compressed data transmission is implemented to further reduce your network costs.
-   High availability: Disaster recovery is ensured for single local servers. You can also deploy multiple nodes to implement disaster recovery across servers or data centers. Cloud-based disaster recovery can be completed automatically across data centers, and links can be restored within seconds of being disconnected.
-   End-to-end ecosystem services: Various database services will be gradually connected to Database Gateway. This allows you to enjoy end-to-end ecosystem services such as cross-cloud, cloud-based, and on-premises services covering database migration, disaster recovery, cross-database JOIN operation, data analysis, and data security capabilities. These end-to-end services can provide consistent cloud database experience for you.
