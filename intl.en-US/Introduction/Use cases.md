-   Company website: [https://www.baixing.com/](https://www.baixing.com/)

**Company profile**

Baixing.com Co., Ltd was established on March 1, 2005. Baixing.com provides leading classified information services and sets a model for asset-light Internet companies in China. Baixing.com is a one-stop information platform that provides local life services. These services include community services, recruitment and job hunting, house rentals and sales, second-hand car trading, second-hand transactions, education and training, and dating in the same city. Baixing.com also provides comprehensive and precise marketing solutions for small and medium-sized merchants.

**Challenges**

Baixing.com was confronted with the following challenges when databases are migrated across clouds:

-   The migration requires the company to open the service ports of the databases to the Internet. This causes potential security risks.
-   The migration requires a VPN or a dedicated connection. This incurs high costs.

**Solutions**

Alibaba Cloud provides a solution that integrates Database Gateway with Alibaba Cloud Data Transmission Service \(DTS\) to help Baixing.com migrate private databases across clouds. This solution does not require Baixing.com to open the service ports of the databases to the Internet. Baixing.com needs only to install Database Gateway agents on database servers to connect databases to Alibaba Cloud. Database Gateway also provides the compressed data transmission and high concurrency features to facilitate long-distance data migration.
