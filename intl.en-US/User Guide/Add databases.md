    -   Log on to the console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Gateway List** to go to the Gateway List page. Click the ID of a gateway in the Running state. On the Details page, click **Adding a Database**.
    -   Log on to the console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Database Information** to go to the Database Information page. Click **Adding a Database**.

        **Note:** In this case, select a database gateway from the drop-down list.
