3.  Install the gateway. To install the gateway, select an installation package based on the type of your operating system. If you use the Windows operating system, click **Download gateway**. If you use other operating systems, copy and paste the command line to the machine where the gateway is to be installed. Then, press Enter to run the command. If the local gateway is started as expected, you are automatically redirected to the Adding a Database page. You can also click **Next step**.
